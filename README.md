## How to Play Against the Trained AI

1. Make sure the model `models/dqn_blackjack.pth` exists.
2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run Playing.py
```

- Click `Hit` or `Stick` to play.
- After your turn, the AI will automatically play its turn.
- Result (win/lose/draw) will be shown at the end.
